## What did you just do?

* Personality questionnaire. (Introversion/Extraversion)

* Social network questionnaire.

* Loneliness questionnaire.

## Let's take a big, big step back.

* Species vary in whether they are group-living or not.

--

* Our primate 'cousins'.

## Dunbar's Number.

* 'Natural' limits to the number of people we can know. **Time** + **Cognition**

--

* 150 number.

--

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("neocortex-size.png") # Neocortex size, Dunbar & Shultz (2007)
```

---
## How do we know this (Dunbar 2008)?

* Anthropological / Archeological data. (Village sizes of Yanomami (Brazil/Venezuela), Aborginal Clans, Archeological findings)

--

* Religious communities (Hutterites)

--

* Social network studies / Surveys (e.g., Christmas cards, Hill & Dunbar, 2003)

--

## Social network: Not homogenous.

## Support clique / Sympathy group.

* Dunbar (2016) argues for +/- (max.) 5 for the support clique (support group) and around max. 15 for the sympathy group.

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("support-sympathy.jpg")
```


---
## What does Personality have to do with this?

* Big 5 / Big 6 (HEXACO): Honesty/Humility - Emotionality - eXtraversion - Agreeableness - Conscientiousness - Openness to Experience.

--

* One dimension: Introversion/Extraversion.

--

* Stable individual differences.

--> Do people who are extraverted have more friends, also at these inner layers?

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("introvert-extravert.jpg") # I can has cheezburger.
```

---
## Previous research on Extraversion and 'offline' networks.

* Roberts et al. (2008) -  extraversion positively associated support group but not sympathy group size (N=168)

--

* Pollet et al. (2011) - extraversion positively associated support group, sympathy group size and outer layer (N=117)

--

* Molho et al. (2016) - extraversion positively associated with support group size but not sympathy group size. (N=525)


---
## Personality and Facebook networks.  

* Brown et al. (in preparation). - Extraversion associated with Facebook Network size (and number of clusters). No effects on Facebook structures

## Social network structure

--> These studies did not examine the *structure* of these layers. What you completed will allow us to look at this more closely.

## Final component: Loneliness (Russell et al. 1996)

* Emotional and social isolation. 

--

* Research shows that Introverts tend to report more loneliness (e.g., Saklofske & Yackulic, 1989) but we do not know how it relates to synthetic

---
## Why does this matter?

* Loneliness equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010)

* National campaign to end loneliness.

* If we want to tackle loneliness, we need to understand it better.

---
## Example of research-led teaching.

* An example of Connor's research.

* You will conduct your own research in labs. For example, on body image, memory. Some of these will include surveys.

---
## Future work. Perhaps even your project?

* Does Instagram help to reduce loneliness?

* How do relationships form when people like yourself move to university? How do they relate to loneliness and living on vs. off campus?

* Loneliness in the elderly. Is it a matter of _any_ contact or specific contacts? Can we use Facetime/Skype to alleviate loneliness?
